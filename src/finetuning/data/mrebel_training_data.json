Pecchenino’s recent contribution [2011, 2015] – drawing in particular on philosophical, theological and psychological conceptions of hope (and its antithesis, despair) – shows, however, that it is possible to model the main characteristics of this counterfactual emotion: hope holds out the prospect of a possibility, of accessible objectives; it notably accentuates the value of the future (in relation to the present), is not irrational from the moment when the individual is capable of correctly filtering the information transmitted to him, represents a force for change (at the level of the individual and society) as well as an ability to mobilize individual effort; hope also depends crucially on the quality of the social bond (the absence of which can, on the contrary, give rise to despair). This reading of hope – from which, in our opinion, it is possible to extract useful lessons in the context of the health crisis that humanity has been experiencing since the beginning of 2020 – shows that the initial reductive conception of emotion in behavioral economics can be overcome.",

This reading of hope – from which, in our opinion, it is possible to extract useful lessons in the context of the health crisis that humanity has been experiencing since the beginning of 2020 – shows that the initial reductive conception of emotion in behavioral economics can be overcome. Similarly, the innovative approach proposed by Thoron [2017] – which emphasizes the relational capacity of emotion – or that of van Winden",
