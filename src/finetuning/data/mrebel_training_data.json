Developing a richer and more complete economy of emotions makes it necessary to also draw on other approaches to emotion, notably from sociology, anthropology, history and philosophy. The aim of this article is to contribute to enriching the work of economists in this field by proposing a multidisciplinary state of the art that synthesizes the knowledge derived from the theory of emotions. The first step is to identify the major stages in the construction of this theory and to extract the essential properties of emotions.

        "text": "As in many academic disciplines, economists have accompanied what historians have called \"the emotional turn\" (Plamper [2010]), an extraordinary craze born in the mid-1990s for the study of emotions. In economics, emotions are today mainly mobilized and studied in an experimental framework and then introduced into behavioral models in order to improve existing models of human behavior. The \"economics of emotions\" (Petit [2015]) has made it possible to \"revisit\" the model of perfect rationality (Elster [1996], Kahneman [2012], Rolls [2019]), has introduced a plurality of social and/or moral motivations (Jourdheuil and Petit [2015]) and has led to new modalities of intervention by public authorities such as emotional paternalism (Schultz et al. [2007]). The introduction of emotion into economic analysis was carried out\nessentially from a psychological and neurological conception of emotion. As suggested by Elster [1998], this conception made it possible (i) to disturb emotion in categories that could be easily mobilized by economists, (ii) to give it a functional (multi-component) definition particularly adapted to the methodological individualism practiced in experimental and behavioral economics and above all (iii) to provide precise and effective instruments for measuring and inducing emotions. The theory of emotions that was gradually established during the 20th century, however, covers a much broader field of analysis than that taken into account by psychology and neuroscience. Other disciplines – such as sociology, philosophy, anthropology, history or literature – have also constructed an elaborate and fruitful theory of emotions. Recent work on the theory of emotions also shows that there is now a convergence between approaches that were once opposed and considered incompatible (biology vs. anthropology, psychology vs. sociology). Developing a richer and more complete “economy of emotions” makes it necessary to know and draw on the different approaches to emotion, without limiting ourselves to the sole conception of psychology and/or neurology. The aim of this review is therefore to contribute to enriching the work of economists in this field by proposing a multidisciplinary state of the art that synthesizes the knowledge derived from the theory of emotions. First, it is a question of identifying the main stages in the construction of this theory and extracting the essential properties of emotions (2). The aim then is to illustrate – as extensively as possible but without claiming to be exhaustive – how this knowledge has been used in economic analysis, taking into account the diversity of approaches characteristic of the discipline (3). We will conclude this review of the literature on the theory and economics of emotions by discussing and identifying the most fruitful and promising areas of research for economists (4).",

First, there are the authors who consider that emotions correspond to an objective empirical reality that can be defined, analyzed, evaluated, and broken down. Schematically, the proponents of this first trend are more located in the life sciences, in the medical sciences, or in experimental sciences such as psychology or neuroscience. Within this first trend, there are, on the one hand, those who give primacy to the bodily, physiological, biological dimension of emotion (2.1) and, on the other hand, those who, by relativizing the scope of the body, reveal the importance of cognition and psychological processes (2.2). Other authors, on the contrary, argue that emotions should be considered rather as objects on which we can formulate a discourse without claiming an operational measurement.",
