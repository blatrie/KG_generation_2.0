        "text": "As in many academic disciplines, economists have accompanied what historians have called \"the emotional turn\" (Plam-per [2010]), an extraordinary craze born in the mid-1990s for the study of emotions. In economics, emotions are today mainly mobilized and studied in an experimental framework and then introduced into behavioral models in order to improve existing models of human behavior. The \"economics of emotions\" (Petit [2015]) has made it possible to \"revisit\" the model of perfect rationality (Elster [1996], Kahneman [2012], Rolls [2019]), has introduced a plurality of social and/or moral motivations (Jourdheuil and Petit [2015]) and has led to new modalities of intervention by public authorities such as emotional paternalism (Schultz et al. [2007]). The introduction of emotion into economic analysis was carried out essentially from a psychological and neurological conception of emotion. As suggested by Elster [1998], this conception made it possible (i) to disturb emotion in categories that could be easily mobilized by economists, (ii) to give it a functional (multi-component) definition particularly adapted to the methodological individualism practiced in experimental and behavioral economics and above all (iii) to provide precise and effective instruments for measuring and inducing emotions. The theory of emotions that was gradually established during the 20th century, however, covers a much broader field of analysis than that taken into account by psychology and neuroscience. Other disciplines – such as sociology, philosophy, anthropology, history or literature – have also constructed an elaborate and fruitful theory of emotions. Recent work on the theory of emotions also shows that there is now a convergence between approaches that were once opposed and considered incompatible (biology vs. anthropology, psychology vs. sociology). Developing a richer and more complete “economy of emotions” makes it necessary to know and draw on the different approaches to emotion, without limiting ourselves to the sole conception of psychology and/or neurology. The aim of this review is therefore to contribute to enriching the work of economists in this field by proposing a multidisciplinary state of the art that synthesizes the knowledge derived from the theory of emotions. First, it is a question of identifying the main stages in the construction of this theory and extracting the essential properties of emotions (2). The aim then is to illustrate – as extensively as possible but without claiming to be exhaustive – how this knowledge has been used in economic analysis, taking into account the diversity of approaches characteristic of the discipline (3). We will conclude this review of the literature on the theory and economics of emotions by discussing and identifying the most fruitful and promising areas of research for economists (4).",

First, there are the authors who consider that emotions correspond to an objective empirical reality that can be defined, analyzed, evaluated, and broken down. Schematically, the proponents of this first trend are more located in the life sciences, in the medical sciences, or in experimental sciences such as psychology or neuroscience. Within this first trend, there are, on the one hand, those who give primacy to the bodily, physiological, biological dimension of emotion (2.1) and, on the other hand, those who, by relativizing the scope of the body, reveal the importance of cognition and psychological processes (2.2). Other authors, on the contrary, argue that emotions should be considered rather as objects on which we can formulate a discourse without claiming an operational measurement.",

The interest of Darwin's work [1872] is to codify on an empirical level a rigorous method of evaluating facial expressions that will be deepened by psychologists and biologists a century later (Ekman and Davidson [1994], Plutchik [1984]) and then used by modern facial recognition technologies (in particular for so-called \"basic\" or \"universal\" emotions (Ekman [1999]). Darwin [1872] thus marks the starting point of the scientific study of emotion. The biological vision of emotion is supported, in the 1880s, by what appears to be the first true psychological theory of emotion, known as the \"James-Lange\" theory.

The interest of the “James-Lange” proposition and the work of its opponents is to fuel the debate on the nature of the relationship between emotion and cognition throughout the 20th century. It will find, in part, its resolution in the work of Schachter [1964] who adds to the “physiological arousal” specific to emotion a “cognitive labeling”, dependent on the context, and thus allows to admit the undifferentiated aspect of physical manifestations. As we see later, this marks the explicit beginning of cognitive and psychosocial theories of emotions (2.2). Another issue – concerning the primacy (or not) of emotion over cognition – will also feed the renewal of psychological theories of emotion in the 1980s. The presupposition of social psychologist Robert Zajonc is that the first reaction to an object or a person is an emotional (adaptive) reaction that can lead to a cognitive reaction. While for cognitive psychologist Richard Lazarus, cognition is a necessary condition for emotion and would therefore come first. The misunderstanding ultimately concerns how to define cognition.",

This brings us back to the unconscious influences of emotion and to the central role that psychoanalysis and psychiatry (Sigmund Freud, Pierre Janet, Henri Wallon) played in this area at the beginning of the last century (see Channouf [2004]). Recent work in neuroscience is in line with the biological and psychological approaches that we have discussed so far. In fact, neurologists locate emotions in the brain (and more broadly in the body) and agree on a universalist and naturalist dimension of emotion. However, they insist on the links existing between the component of emotion inscribed in the body and its cognitive extension in the brain: this aims in particular at taking into account the intention specific to the emotion as well as its memorial or temporal dimension.",

As in James [1884], it is when he becomes aware of these reactions that the individual becomes aware of the emotion. According to Damasio [1995], when a similar situation arises, it evokes the central cerebral representations of the body image linked to these peripheral modifications. These representations thus play the role of \"somatic markers\" which allow, when we are again faced with similar situations or events, to immediately become aware of the emotion, and to associate with it traits of appropriate action behaviors. The marker would therefore function as an emotional memory, an emotional labeling of the event or landscape, as a warning or encouragement signal (innate or acquired) of cognitive and unconscious origin. Damasio's thesis [1995] found a very favorable echo in the academic world because it managed to convincingly overturn the preconceived idea that emotions would be a disruptor of decision-making.",

We can no longer oppose reason and emotion, cognitive and volitional faculties on the one hand and bodily and unconscious affectivity on the other, as Western thought has done for centuries. Emotions, on the contrary, appear to be necessary for human beings to be able to pursue long-term planned activities, to be able to react adequately to events and to maintain with others the relationships without which no practical rationality is possible. They therefore have an impact that can be direct, but also indirect and unconscious, and which is very often useful for individual decision-making. 2.2.",

The existence of this emotional differential provokes a necessary work of \"revision\" which aims to align our perception of the world with what the world tells us objectively. Emotion thus serves us, like an alarm signal, to re-evaluate our priorities in the medium term or to readjust our objectives when reality does not conform to what we expect of it. Emotion is a form of guide that allows us to adapt to our environment, like “somatic markers” (Damasio [1995]). However, when we chronically and systematically resist this revision process, and the emotion repeats itself (whether it is disappointment, anger or any other emotion), it reveals to us the importance that we give to particular desires, beliefs or preferences, which in fact correspond to our most deeply rooted values ​​that we do not wish to give up. The dynamics of emotion generated by this gap between values ​​and perceived reality show that emotion can be a way of accessing the value systems of the individual (but also those of the group) by taking into account the resistance to change as well as the desire for change.  2.3. The social and cultural construction of emotion Overlooking (but also relying on) the philosophy of mind and cognitivism, some authors see emotion more as the expression of a socially and culturally constructed society. Emotion is here considered as a product of the social in the sense that society would manufacture the feelings and emotional behavior of individuals. Emotions are (certainly) dispositions connected to the body but the body itself is shaped by culture and the times.",

In the sociological and anthropological approach to emotions, it is the group that must be considered as a priority when we question the formation of individual emotions. A first key idea can be summarized by saying that the social constrains, in a deterministic way, the emotions of individuals and their way of behaving. These are, in other words, the ritual practices, the codes, the norms, the “rules of feelings”, which dictate the emotional behaviors typical of a culture or a collective (Mauss [1921]).",

Every society, every nation, has its own emotional codes which exert a strong influence on what people feel and on the way they feel.

Following the work of Goffman [1974], we understand that the game of deﬁguration of emotion depends closely on social position and constrains those who, at the lowest level of the hierarchical ladder, are concerned about the way the dominants look at them. According to Bourdieu, these mechanisms of reproduction of emotional codes are the result of a socialization strongly charged with emotion that begins in the child and is perpetuated, in the form of affective habitus, in the adult. Emotions, like tastes, are determined by status, social itinerary and fueled by the recurrence of typical situations linked to economic and social conditions of existence (Emirbayer et al. [2005]). The second important idea in the social construction of emotion is that the way we perceive our emotions (and those of others) has a central cultural dimension. In other words, many emotions are felt differently depending on the culture in which they are expressed. Moreover, in all cultures, these emotions are interpreted from a naive theory of emotion to which individuals subscribe and fully adhere.",

On the other hand, economic sociology (3.2) has drawn on the achievements of the sociological and anthropological approach to emotions (2.3) in order to show how social and cultural dynamics shape the emotional attitudes of individuals. For institutional economics (3.3), if the introduction of emotions remains a relatively unexplored field (Patalano [2010]), recent work reveals why emotion plays a major role in the transformation of institutions via modifications of individual behaviors. 3.1.",

In this context, they mobilize many “heuristics” (such as that of affectivity) or behavioral biases (such as the conﬁrmation bias) mentioned by psychologists to identify the role of emotion in decision-making. In terms of methodology and the use of experimental tools, economists have also relied on psychology and neuroscience to induce certain types of emotions in the laboratory and obtain a viable and precise measurement of the intensity of emotions and moods felt or perceived by individuals. Mood induction methods, personality tests, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), measurements of facial expressions or even the subjective assessment of emotions, etc., are now part of the classic tools of experimental economists.",

Based on standard neoclassical theory, the introduction of emotions into experimental and behavioral economics has had, according to Petit [2015], three notable consequences. First of all, it allowed us to dismantleEmmanuel Petit— ... Second important consequence: by introducing a plurality of emotions – and in particular those with a positive valence (such as gratitude or pride) – economists have been led to downplay the scope of individual selfishness (see Jourdheuil and Petit [2015] for a review) and to question more about the choice procedure in the presence of moral or ethical dilemmas (Rustichini [2018]). The diversity of (moral) emotions and the emphasis on the role of empathy (Thoron [2017]) have thus led to highlighting the plurality of human motivations – whether trust, reciprocity, cooperation or a sense of fairness – while also showing the major role of context in the emergence of these social or moral preferences.",

Pecchenino’s recent contribution [2011, 2015] – drawing in particular on philosophical, theological and psychological conceptions of hope (and its antithesis, despair) – shows, however, that it is possible to model the main characteristics of this counterfactual emotion: hope holds out the prospect of a possibility, of accessible objectives; it notably accentuates the value of the future (in relation to the present), is not irrational from the moment when the individual is capable of correctly filtering the information transmitted to him, represents a force for change (at the level of the individual and society) as well as an ability to mobilize individual effort; hope also depends crucially on the quality of the social bond (the absence of which can, on the contrary, give rise to despair). This reading of hope – from which, in our opinion, useful lessons can be extracted in the context of the health crisis that humanity has been experiencing since the beginning of 2020 – shows that the initial reductive conception of emotion in behavioral economics can be overcome. Similarly, the innovative approach proposed by Thoron [2017] – which emphasizes the relational capacity of emotion – or that of van Winden [2012, 2015] – which insists on the existence of affective-social links between agents (see Petit [2018] for a review) – indicate a possible overcoming (or extension) of this initial orientation. This extension can notably be inspired, in the field of economic analysis, by other approaches that have explored the question of emotions, as is the case in economic sociology (3.2) or the economics of institutions (3.3). 3.2. Economic sociology or the control of emotions The rejection of pure rationality and the absence of consideration of the social and culture constitute unifying elements of the sociological approach to emotions (2.3). This approach has benefited from the founding works around the sociology of rituals (Parsons [1937]), interactionist thought (Goffman [1974]), relational sociology (Laflamme [1995]) or even the anthropological communication approach (Bateson [1991]) (see Berezin [2006] and Bernard [2017] for reviews).",

Two themes bring together a large part of this literature (mainly carried by sociologists) which starts from the principle that individual emotions are shaped by society. One questions the control, imposed by the market and companies, of employees' emotions (3.2.1). The other highlights the way in which the market itself produces and sells emotion (3.2.2). 3.2.1. Emotions under control During the 20th century, the development of capitalism led to the development of an entrepreneurial culture that gave a central place to emotional life in companies and organizations. By integrating affects, economic logic transformed the traditional divisions – reason/emotion, public/private, masculine/feminine – that had prevailed until then. In the mid-1930s, the scientific approach to regulating emotions met with a very strong demand from companies wishing to develop worker performance.",

Emotions for sale It may seem strange that we can attribute a price to emotion and that affectivity is itself a commercial issue. Jeudy-Ballini [2004] nevertheless mentioned the existence of a “price” for the expression of emotion within the Sulka community in Papua New Guinea: when a sulka intentionally provokes a negative emotion (anger, shame, etc.) in another, the latter is expected to claim material compensation. The most paradoxical thing is that, even in the presence of an emotion with a positive valence (such as admiration or delight), the emotional impact induced – for example, in a spectator by the beauty of a mask, a song or a dance – can be the subject of a request for compensation as soon as the person experiencing it makes a statement about it (Derlon and Jeudy-Ballini [2008]). In the market system, such a price does not exist. However, it is easy to understand that a poker player who has poor control over his emotions at a table will quickly lose a lot of money.",

The conceptualization work of Markey-Towler [2018] thus shows that there is a potential for introducing emotion into the institutionalist approach that is based on the intersection of related literatures. 4. Scope and challenges of the economics of emotions for the discipline Our review of the literature on the introduction of the theory of emotions into economic analysis has shown that this abundant literature is now based on an open and multidisciplinary conception of emotion: to the conventional approaches of biology and psychology are added studies in the social and human sciences around sociology, anthropology but also history and naturally philosophy. Apprehended in a more global and more complete way, emotion has thus been introduced both in the field of experimental and behavioral economics but also progressively in economic sociology or by institutionalist authors. It thus emerges from our review that the most recent \"economics of emotions\" has largely benefited from an in-depth theoretical knowledge of the science of emotions.

This is an undeniable asset but it is also a limitation of the analysis when, taking into account the polymorphic nature of emotion (we often make a parallel with color or music), it arises in a specific social and cultural context mixed with other affects (or even other emotions).

        "text": "The contribution of behavioral economics is therefore reduced since it is based on an exclusively psychological or neurological analysis. This methodological limitation – mainly linked to the focus on the “interiority” specific to emotion – does not allow us to truly address certain social or political issues related to emotions (such as, for example, the origins and manifestations of fear induced by a pandemic within a population). This is particularly the case with the question of the effects of “collective emotions” which requires conceptualization work that philosophy is able to produce (see in particular the excellent presentation made by Salmela [2020]). Following Livet [2002] but also Rimé [2005], it is a question of questioning the way in which an emotion can be \"shared\" socially, imitated, \"aggregated\", felt collectively or transmitted, etc., within a community, a population or even a group. The above leads us to question the scope of emotion within the institutional economy. As we have suggested, the eco-Emmanuel Petit— ... Paradoxically, this potential has not yet been realized, neither with regard to the “old” institutionalism of John Commons or Thorstein Veblen, nor with regard to neo-institutionalism (Patalano [2010]), emotion remaining to this day in our opinion the missing piece of this current of analysis. Some recent conceptual work, however, suggests that it is possible to “endogenize” individual emotions in such a way as to account for their active role in modifying the subject’s environment. Petit and Ballet [2021], for example, translate this idea of ​​endogeneity using John Dewey’s theory of emotions. For the pragmatist author, emotion signals the need for change and is at the same time an active and central agent in the reconfiguration of individual habits. We can then consider a modification of habits, through emotion, which goes well beyond what the behavioral theory of “nudge” can propose (Thaler and Sunstein [2010]).",

In conclusion When, more than thirty years ago, economists began to mobilize the register of emotion in their work, they most often did so in a rather vague way – not making a distinction (as psychologists do today) between mood, emotion and feeling. Furthermore, their analysis was based on scattered, rather undeveloped and imprecise elements of the theory of emotions. Since Elster's seminal review [1998], the introduction of emotion into analysis has received greater attention and has been the subject of a rapidly expanding literature. 9.",
