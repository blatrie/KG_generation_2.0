Throughout his career, Dewey also contributed to the development of a rich and complex theory of emotions. In this article, we show how John Dewey’s philosophy is likely to contribute to the introduction of a process – emotion – into a discipline that immediately assumes a very high level of rationality in behavior.

THE RESHAPING OF THE ECONOMIC INDIVIDUAL AND DECISION-MAKING\nInherited from the tradition of political economy and reinforced by the “marginalist revolution”, the figure of homo economicus has emerged during the 20th century as the central representation from which economic models and the resulting economic policy recommendations are articulated. The economic agent is thus assumed to be rational – in the sense that he maximizes his interests by taking into account the constraints that apply to him – and has, in particular, full free will and perfect self-control when making decisions.

For each of these activities, it can be, as Dewey specifies, \"an experience\" (Dewey, 1934/2005, p. 81, Dewey's emphasis), which indicates both its singular (it can be banal) and extraordinary character: it is unique, not systematic; it has a plot, a beginning, a progression and a denouement.

This literature has largely highlighted the \nfiliation between habits in William James (1931a; 1931b; \n1956) and this movement of economic theory (Twomey 1998; \nHodgson 2003; Lawlor 2005; Barbalet 2008).

As Albert and Ramstad (1997) point out, both authors subscribe to non-dualist thinking, place the notion of “transaction” at the heart of their theory, and make habit an essential determinant of individual behavior. In John Dewey, we find, as early as the 1890s (notably in the articles of 1894, 1895, 1896) and then in his work published in \n1922 – Human Nature and Conduct: Introduction to Social Psychology – a \nfirst sketch (which will be developed in particular in Art as \nExperience, 2005) of the role of emotions (or impulses) in the \ntransformation of individual habits.",

Dewey introduces emotions to think about disruptive trajectories\nin institutions. He emphasizes in particular the close complementarity of emotion and reason in the transformation of institutions:\n“To say that emotions do not ally with intelligence are blind\nis a banality.

Dewey thus completes the traditional institutionalist analysis that focuses primarily on the role of habits and the routinization of institutions. We have illustrated Dewey's contribution with the example of the France Télécom case, the trial of which in 2019 resulted in a significant change in the rules of law relating to human resources management in companies in France.",

Unlike other memories, those related to fear are capable not only of eliciting a response to fear but also of completely re-initiating the negative experience caused by the event initially presenting a danger.

As suggested by the work on “post-memory” (Hirsch [2017]), the emotional power of certain traumatic events (such as fratricidal wars or epidemics) is so strong that these events that occurred in the past see their effects continue unconsciously in the present within generations that did not experience them. A central question concerning fear is how an individual can regulate it, control it when its origin may be unconscious in nature. Psychologists who work on these questions know that one cannot suppress an emotion, that it is very complex to oust it or to “compensate” for it with another (as many philosophers proposed in the 18th century (see Hirschman [1977])) and that, in this matter, cognitive effort or even financial incentive are not very operationals (Ler-neret al.",

The approach of historians (Delumeau [1978], Robin [2008]) reminds us in particular of the weight of institutions in the social construction of fear. A climate of collective fear established by a particular event (September 11, 2001) can lead to the acceptance of public policies in different spheres of public or private life (Internet surveillance activity, restriction of mobility, freedoms and modes of expression, censorship, etc.), even if they are not linked to the original fear.

Overall, the contributions of experimental economics, sociology or the institutionalist approach remain in fact still very compartmentalized. Given the very nature of emotion – linked to the body, to cognition as much as to the social – it seems to us that these literatures deserve to be more identified.entiﬁed, analyzed and especially “mixed” or “nested”.

Some economists, however, encourage integrating hope into economic analysis and going beyond related notions – close to but different from hope – recently introduced by the behavioral approach (Pleeging and Burger, 2020, 2021): expectations , aspirations, optimism, confidence 4. Close to psychology, behavioral economics aims to introduce an emotion that fits well with the methodological individualism characteristic of the discipline. By taking up a canonical definition of hope in psychology,\n\"[t]o hope for an outcome is to desire it (to be attracted to it), to attribute\nto it a probability between 0 and 1, and to judge that there are sufficient reasons\nto engage in certain attitudes and activities aiming\nto achieve it\" (Martin, 2003, 7-8).",

Many authors have pointed out that, by criticizing the \n“Facts”4, and by addressing a fierce criticism to Bentham’s utilitarianism, Dickens exposes in a partial and probably excessive way the rational doctrine of the English mentor (Arneson, 1978; Peltason, 1988; \nHarris, 1998; Twining, 1998; Ablow, 2014).

The critics agree in fact \nto consider that Dickens refers to the most “common” or vulgarized forms of Benthamite utilitarianism relayed by the press of his time, a press whose diffusion among the entire Victorian population played an essential role in the circulation of ideas. Dickens was also greatly influenced by the newspaper The Morning Chronicle for which he worked in his youth – a newspaper praised by John Stuart Mill because it disseminated Bentham’s ideas to the general public.

Many authors have highlighted the connection that can be made, around the question of education, between Dickens’ novel Hard Times and Mill’s life as depicted in his autobiography (Nussbaum, 1998, 2004; McReynolds, 2007; Dixon, 2012). The character of Mr. Gradgrind, for example, whose face is \"inflexible, \nutilitarian and positive\" (HT, 148), would illustrate the very strict and rational model of education that the young Mill received from his father, James Mill, a friend of Jeremy Bentham and a convinced utilitarian.

By making this comparison between Charles Dickens and John Stuart Mill, we were able to show that both oppose the rational vision of Benthamite utilitarianism, and on the contrary emphasize the power of imagination, poetry, intellectual pleasures and, of course, writing.

This conception, which is clearly explained by \nDewey’s (1934) evocation of the artist’s relationship with creativity, also demonstrates \nthat inquiry has a strong social dimension.11 In the case of moral inquiry in particular, \nthis suggests that individuals, taking into account the multiple transactions that occur \n(between themselves and their environment), can, via the imagination, reconsider their \ndesires and relate them to the values to which they adhere (McVea, 2007). This brings us to an important point of convergence between Dewey’s analysis \n(integrating emotion) and the standard and/or behavioural approach in economics. Drawing on work by psychologists, economists have found that emotions can be con-\nsciously (and often correctly) anticipated by individuals.",

Typically, the informational loop described in Figure 1, \nwhich corresponds to Dewey’s thinking on valuation, enables us to better understand \nhow anticipation influences the inquiry process.

Conclusion\nIn this article, we have set out to highlight what John Dewey’s theory of emotions—a \ntheory that has been somewhat neglected in the literature—can contribute to the con-\ntemporary debate on the emergence of values in economics. The non-dualistic approach \nadopted by the pragmatist author enables the renewal of this debate by deconstructing \nthe characteristic opposition between ends and means in standard theory, and by put-\nting emotion and imagination at the heart of moral inquiry.",

We believe that the approach to valuation proposed by Dewey can shed light on nu-\nmerous debates, from issues concerning inequalities and conflicts to the environmental \nquestion. To conclude, we shall briefly illustrate its scope in relation to the issue of \nclimate change, to which a pragmatist philosophical interpretation has recently been \napplied (Cojocaru, 2020).

As we know, this issue generates \na wide range of intense emotions—from fear and anger to despair—which are often \nperceived in the literature as obstacles to action in favour of climate change mitiga-\ntion.

Abstract:\nClémence Royer (1830–1902), a figure of the emancipation of women \neconomists\nIn this article, we highlight the remarkable work of Clémence Royer, a woman of science \nand a figure of the emancipation of women economists. Her career and her work raise the \nquestion of her relationship to self-education and account for the difficulties she encoun -\ntered in her intellectual trajectory. The scientific scope of her work, and in particular her \ncontribution to economics—via the publication of the Theory of Tax in 1862—\nanticipated the emergence of themes (equity of taxation, the place of education, women’s \nwork) that would be developed in an innovative way by women economists at the end of \nthe twentieth century, in particular within the feminist economics school of thought.",
