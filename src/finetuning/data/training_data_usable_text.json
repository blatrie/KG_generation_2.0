Throughout his career, Dewey also contributed to the development of a rich and complex theory of emotions. In this article, we show how John Dewey’s philosophy is likely to contribute to the introduction of a process – emotion – into a discipline that immediately assumes a very high level of rationality in behavior.

THE RESHAPING OF THE ECONOMIC INDIVIDUAL AND DECISION-MAKING\nInherited from the tradition of political economy and reinforced by the “marginalist revolution”, the figure of homo economicus has emerged during the 20th century as the central representation from which economic models and the resulting economic policy recommendations are articulated. The economic agent is thus assumed to be rational – in the sense that he maximizes his interests by taking into account the constraints that apply to him – and has, in particular, full free will and perfect self-control when making decisions.

For each of these activities, it can be, as Dewey specifies, \"an experience\" (Dewey, 1934/2005, p. 81, Dewey's emphasis), which indicates both its singular (it can be banal) and extraordinary character: it is unique, not systematic; it has a plot, a beginning, a progression and a denouement.

This literature has largely highlighted the \nfiliation between habits in William James (1931a; 1931b; \n1956) and this movement of economic theory (Twomey 1998; \nHodgson 2003; Lawlor 2005; Barbalet 2008).

As Albert and Ramstad (1997) point out, both authors subscribe to non-dualist thinking, place the notion of “transaction” at the heart of their theory, and make habit an essential determinant of individual behavior. In John Dewey, we find, as early as the 1890s (notably in the articles of 1894, 1895, 1896) and then in his work published in \n1922 – Human Nature and Conduct: Introduction to Social Psychology – a \nfirst sketch (which will be developed in particular in Art as \nExperience, 2005) of the role of emotions (or impulses) in the \ntransformation of individual habits.",

Dewey introduces emotions to think about disruptive trajectories\nin institutions. He emphasizes in particular the close complementarity of emotion and reason in the transformation of institutions:\n“To say that emotions do not ally with intelligence are blind\nis a banality.

Dewey thus completes the traditional institutionalist analysis that focuses primarily on the role of habits and the routinization of institutions. We have illustrated Dewey's contribution with the example of the France Télécom case, the trial of which in 2019 resulted in a significant change in the rules of law relating to human resources management in companies in France.",

Unlike other memories, those related to fear are capable not only of eliciting a response to fear but also of completely re-initiating the negative experience caused by the event initially presenting a danger.

As suggested by the work on “post-memory” (Hirsch [2017]), the emotional power of certain traumatic events (such as fratricidal wars or epidemics) is so strong that these events that occurred in the past see their effects continue unconsciously in the present within generations that did not experience them. A central question concerning fear is how an individual can regulate it, control it when its origin may be unconscious in nature. Psychologists who work on these questions know that one cannot suppress an emotion, that it is very complex to oust it or to “compensate” for it with another (as many philosophers proposed in the 18th century (see Hirschman [1977])) and that, in this matter, cognitive effort or even financial incentive are not very operationals (Ler-neret al.",

The approach of historians (Delumeau [1978], Robin [2008]) reminds us in particular of the weight of institutions in the social construction of fear. A climate of collective fear established by a particular event (September 11, 2001) can lead to the acceptance of public policies in different spheres of public or private life (Internet surveillance activity, restriction of mobility, freedoms and modes of expression, censorship, etc.), even if they are not linked to the original fear.

Overall, the contributions of experimental economics, sociology or the institutionalist approach remain in fact still very compartmentalized. Given the very nature of emotion – linked to the body, to cognition as much as to the social – it seems to us that these literatures deserve to be more identified.entiﬁed, analyzed and especially “mixed” or “nested”.

The Economics of Hope in Reading Charles Dickens’s Novel Great Hopes Emmanuel Petit 1 and Nathalie Vanfasse 2, 3 Abstract The rational economic approach has paid relatively little attention to hope, a fundamental emotion that reflects a state of mind, determines our attitude toward the future, our management of uncertainty, and conditions our actions and decisions.

In this article, we will seek to determine what a dialogue between literature and economics could bring to both the understanding of hope, economic analysis, and the interpretation of Dickens’s novel. We propose to explore a Dickens novel \ncentered on hope, namely Great Expectations (1861). What is striking when reading the novel is that Dickens explores and deepens in his novel the very notion of hopes (expectations in English) in the economic sense, \nby declining it in various ways and studying the implications of these different \ndeclinations.",

It thus starts from expectations, aspirations and anticipations of a very rational type, very similar to what standard economic theory will later study, to highlight its limits and evolve towards a more complex definition of an economic hope of a more spiritual and philosophical nature, closer to what economists are developing today in the face of the very uncertain future that lies before us. 1.
